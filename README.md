The Google Play Deals Bot was created to do two things for the /r/GooglePlayDeals subreddit:

* respond to all app submissions on /r/GooglePlayDeals with information about the app found on the store page. 
* handle flairing deals when they are expired. 

These are the current features but here are a few more I would like to implement:

* Logging (errors, post id's)
* Getting links from text posts
* (more to come when I remember them)

In order to run the bot, you need to fill out the Config.py file but currently we don't need another version of the bot running around so that probably won't matter. I'm uploading this to github for better version control and also because a few users have wanted to view the source of the bot. Any help would be appreciated if you want to. (first time writing Python)
